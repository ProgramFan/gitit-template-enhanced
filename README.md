# Enhanced Gitit Wiki in Docker

This is an enhanced gitit wiki template, together with docker deployment. I
made the following enhancements:

1. Modern theme with gitit-bootstrap
2. New logo stolen from wikimedia
3. Ace-based markdown editor with preview support, with the help of
   bootstrap-markdown-editor.
4. A seperate `Create a page` link with dialog.
5. Better commit message suggetion based on the page name.

Feel free to use or fork.
